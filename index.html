<h1>Earth Sense</h1>

<p> We know you want to do the right thing. But recycling can be hard. With all these rules, it can be tough remembering what goes where.</p>

<div>That's why we're here. To make the right thing, the easy thing to do.</div>

<p>Don't know where it goes? Don't know if it's garbage or recycling?</p>

<div>No Problem. Just type in the name of the item into the search bar and it'll tell you. </div>


<p>Better yet, enter your location and it'll find the nearest recycling center for you. </p>
